NT-REST is a HTTP/REST adapter for Windows(TM) Desktop APIs.
NT-REST is a background service which provides web-services to third party web-sites and mobile applications.

NOTE: NT-REST is Windows(TM) specific so far. Specifically Windows(TM) 8.1 and Windows(TM) 10 are supported. Linux and Mac versions are possible in theory, but we prefer to focus on 88% of desktops for now. We really love Linux though ❤️.

== Why?

=== The Problem

In general web applications are cheaper to develop, cheaper to maintain, and cheaper to deploy, than desktop applications.
Many tasks which were considered too heavy for the web in the past, are implemented with web technologies now.
Microsoft(TM) Excel(TM) Online and Google(TM) Sheets(TM) for spreadsheets, Figma(TM) for graphics design are great examples of such modern web applications.

On the other hand, in some environments, desktop PCs cannot replace mobile devices. But mobile operating systems, either Android(TM) or iOS(TM) provide limited to no support for features considered usual for a desktop.

Many enterprise applications could be web-based but are not, because they need access to various desktop-only APIs.

==== Printing and imaging

Neither web-browsers, not mobile operating systems, provide any usable printing APIs.
Printing is important, whether it is cheque, report or handout.
Most websites just give up on printing and export PDFs asking users to print them by some external means.
Most mobile applications do not support printing at all; some use highly restricted, almost dysfunctional, vendor specific solutions.
Mobile user experience is terrible, starting with printer discovery and ending with A4/Letter confusion.
If printing is an essential part of an application’s workflow, like for a cash desk, web or mobile technologies are simply unusable.
Google Cloud Print is https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9633006[discontinued^], so the situation will become even worse.
Scanning with preview and crop? It's simply impossible.

==== Industrial devices

There are a lot of industrial hardware devices, whch are very specific to corresponding industies.
None of them can be accessed from a web-browser, if not explicitly supported, like FIDO tokens.
However, most devices can be accessed via text-based protocols over serial ports. Modems with their AT command set, various rugged meters, thermal printers speaking ESC/P.
Web-browsers provide no APIs to communicate over serial ports, while serial port semantics maps to web sockets pretty well.

==== Authentication, Authorization, Audit

Web-browsers give no direct access to authorization, authentication and audit APIs provided by an operating system.
Windows(TM) workstations are usually joined to an Active Directory(TM) domain.
Permissions are managed by group membership within a domain.
Usual enterprise has hundreds, if not thousands, of configuration entries.
Group policies, restricted logon hours, whitelisted logon workstations, centralized collection of event logs serve daily needs.
Every desktop application may call a few simple APIs to check if a current user has a privilege, is a member of some group, or simply list all groups of a current user.
Writing an important message to the event log is not a hard task either.
But web based applications, if not run in local network under very specific configuration, cannot access authentication and authorization information.
Any other web based application has no single sign-on, and no federated Active Directory(TM) authentication.
Event log is never accessible.

=== The Solution

NT-REST.
A Windows(TM) background service which provides HTTP/REST web-services to utilize Windows(TM) Desktop APIs.
Web and mobile applications can now fully integrate into desktop environments.

==== Secure

Security is paramount for the modern web. Nothing in NT-REST is implictly allowed.
Permissions are fine grained by Origin and API family.
Only Administrators can change configuration.
If possible, processing of data is performed by a separate process in a sandboxed environment.

==== Robust

Source code is verified with various static code analysis tools, and compiles without warnings.
Binaries are verified with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/application-verifier[Microsoft(TM) Application Verifier^].

==== Manageable

Configuration is stored in Windows(TM) Registry and can be easily managed by Active Directory group policies or by https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/310516/#syntax[REG files^] distributed and applied separately.

== How?

* Install precompiled binaries xref:how-tos:how-to-install.adoc[]
* Or compile by yourself xref:how-tos:how-to-compile.adoc[]

== Who?

We are TrifleSoft LLC.
I am Roman, a fanatical developer. I have being employed in various financial institutions most of my career and I am simply tired with current state of things in enterprise software development.

NOTE: While I know a lot, I do not consider myself an indisputable expert. Any piece of advice is very welcome.

== Roadmap

* [x] Version API;
* [x] Local authentication API;
* [x] Relay authentication API;
* [x] Identification API;
* [x] Event log API;
* [x] Fingerprinting API;
* [ ] Local printing API;
* [ ] Cloud printing API.
* [ ] Cloud printing additional file formats: Microsoft(TM) Word(TM), Microsoft(TM) Excel(TM), etc.
* [ ] Local scanning API;
* [ ] Cloud scanning API.
* [ ] Serial port API;
* [ ] Executables are digitally signed by Extended Validation certificate. SmartScreen will never report a false positive.
* [ ] Executables are verified against anti-virus databases. Most popular anti-viruses will never report a false positive.
* [ ] Source code is verified by an external security audit.
